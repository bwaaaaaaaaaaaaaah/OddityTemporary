# Chapter 3 ,  Training Day

The Training Complex smelled like ozone and antiseptic.

Evory had expected something more dramatic, explosions? Maybe. Or the kind of high-tech facility she'd seen in action movies. Instead, the underground training floor looked almost clinical: reinforced gray walls made from concrete, modular platforms arranged in a grid pattern, and a silence that felt too heavy for a room this large.

The silence bothered her more than anything.

She was standing with a group of twelve other first and second year Vanguard students near the main entrance, all of them dressed in the standard Academy training uniform: close-fitting gray fabric designed to move with the body without catching on anything. Hana stood beside her, fidgeting with the zipper of her jacket.

"You're bouncing," Hana whispered.

Evory looked down. Her feet were, in fact, making tiny micro-jumps against the floor, a nervous habit she'd developed years ago. Her oddity made it effortless, but it was still embarrassing.

"Sorry..." she muttered, forcing herself to stand still. Her ears were already at full alert, twitching toward every sound in the cavernous space. "It's just... this is the first real assessment session, right? Not just theoretical or orientation stuff. Actual combat assessment."

"That's what the schedule said." Hana glanced around the room, her expression a mixture of excitement and thinly veiled anxiety. "Applied Combat Tactics with Instructor Honda. I heard he's intense."

"Intense good or intense bad?"

"Intense *intense*."

Before Evory could ask for clarification, the main doors on the far side of the training floor opened, and a man walked in.

Takeshi Honda was not what she'd expected.

He was solidly built, athletic in the way of someone who maintained their body through discipline rather than enhancement. Black hair cut short and practical. Dark eyes that swept across the group of students with the calculating efficiency of someone cataloging threats. A small scar near his left eyebrow caught the overhead lighting.

He wore the same gray training uniform as the students, but somehow it looked different on him. Sharper. More intentional.

"Good morning," he said, his voice carrying easily through the space without being loud. "I am Takeshi Honda. You will address me as Instructor Honda. I am responsible for teaching you how not to die."

No introduction. No welcome speech. Just that flat statement of purpose.

"The Vanguard Program exists because oddity bearers exist," Honda continued, moving toward the center of the training floor. "You are here because someone, an admissions board, a recommendation committee, or in some cases, simple bureaucratic necessity, decided that you might be useful in crisis situations. My job is to determine if that decision was correct."

He stopped in the center of the room and turned to face them.

"Most of you will fail."

The words hung in the air. Someone behind Evory shifted uncomfortably as the silence stretched.

"Not fail this class," Honda clarified. "Fail in the field. Fail when it matters. Fail in ways that cost lives... yours, civilians', or your teammates'. The purpose of this training is to make that failure happen here, where the consequences are recoverable, rather than in the real world, where they are not."

His gaze swept across the students again, and Evory felt it pass over her like a lighthouse beam.

"Today is an assessment. I need to understand what each of you can do, what you cannot do, and how you react when you reach the edge of your capability. You will demonstrate your oddity in a controlled exercise. You will push until I tell you to stop. You will not argue, hesitate, or hold back more than absolutely necessary for safety."

He paused.

"Questions?"

No one spoke.

"Good." Honda turned toward a control panel embedded in the far wall. "First group: positions."

---

The exercises were brutal.

Honda had divided them into groups of four, cycling through each set while the others observed from the raised platforms at the edge of the training floor. The exercises varied depending on the students' oddities, some were obstacle courses, others were target elimination, a few were simply "demonstrate maximum output in a contained space."

Evory watched intently as her classmates revealed their oddities.

A boy with crystalline growths along his arms shaped barriers from thin air, defending against rubber projectiles shot by an automated turret. A girl whose skin shimmered with an iridescent sheen moved faster than Evory could track, leaving afterimages as she dismantled training dummies. A quiet student with no visible mutation simply *looked* at a reinforced wall, and a section of it crumbled to dust.

The power levels varied enormously. Some students were clearly in the Rank 2-3 range, capable but limited. Others pushed into 4 or 5 territory, their oddities reshaping the immediate environment in visible ways.

And then there was Hana's turn.

Her oddity, sonic emission, Evory recalled, manifested as concentrated sound waves that she could direct with her hands. In the exercise, she shattered three training dummies with focused bursts, the noise sharp enough that Evory's ears flattened instinctively despite the distance.

"Not bad," was all Honda said when Hana finished. His expression gave nothing away.

Evory was in the third group.

The exercise was an agility course: elevated platforms at varying heights, moving obstacles, and a series of targets that had to be tagged in sequence. Simple enough for someone who could jump like she could.

"Hale," Honda called. "Show me what your SpringJump can do."

Evory stepped onto the starting platform and took a breath.

The whistle blew.

She moved.

The first jump carried her 4 meters straight up, her body tucking and rotating mid-air before she touched down on a narrow beam. Her muscles stretched and contracted with practiced precision, the elastic fibers in her legs storing and releasing energy like coiled springs.

She tagged the first target.

The second jump was horizontal, a lateral leap that covered nearly six meters, her trajectory curving as she pushed off a wall at an angle that would have probably broken a normal person's ankles.

Second target.

Third jump. Fourth. Fifth. The world became a blur of platforms and obstacles, her body reacting faster than conscious thought. This was what her oddity was for, not raw power, but precision. Speed. The ability to be exactly where she needed to be before anyone expected her to be there.

She finished the course in forty-seven seconds.

Not the fastest time, the iridescent girl had cleared it in thirty-two, but respectable. Evory landed on the finishing platform with barely a wobble, her heart pounding and her muscles already registering the strain.

Honda was watching from the observation deck, his expression still unreadable.

"Adequate," he said. "Your form is clean. Your ceiling is clear. The question is whether you can maintain that output under stress."

It wasn't praise, exactly. But it wasn't dismissal either.

Evory stepped back to join the other observers, trying not to let her relief show too openly.

---

The fourth group was when everything changed.

Mizuki Kaminari walked onto the training floor alone.

Evory hadn't seen her enter the complex, hadn't even realized she was in the room until that moment. But there she was, stepping out of whatever shadow she'd been occupying, her movements as controlled and economical as ever.

She was wearing the same gray training uniform as everyone else. Her tail had been threaded through an opening in the back of the pants, swaying slightly as she moved. Her dorsal fin caught the overhead lighting, the rough texture of her shark skin visible even from this distance.

The other students shifted.

It was subtle, the same social choreography Evory had observed in the cafeteria. Bodies leaning away almost imperceptibly. Gazes finding convenient other directions. The bubble of space that followed Mizuki everywhere, now made even more obvious.

Honda showed no such hesitation.

"Kaminari," he said, his voice carrying the same flat professionalism he'd used with every other student. "You know the parameters?"

Mizuki nodded once.

"Full output assessment. Controlled discharge only. I've cleared the safety margins for your ranking, but the suppression systems will activate if you exceed the designated envelope. Understood?"

Another nod.

"Begin when ready."

For a moment, nothing happened.

Mizuki stood in the center of the training floor, her silver eyes fixed on something no one else could see. Her expression was the same neutral mask she always wore, but there was something different in her posture now. A tension that hadn't been there before.

And then her eyes began to glow.

It started slowly, a pale luminescence that crept across her irises like fog. But within seconds, the glow intensified until her eyes were twin points of blinding white light, bright enough that Evory had to squint even from twenty meters away.

The air changed.

Evory felt it before she saw it: a pressure building in the space around Mizuki, like the atmosphere before a thunderstorm. Her bunny ears flattened against her skull, responding to something her conscious mind couldn't identify. The hair on her arms stood up. A faint crackling sound filled the room.

Static. Everywhere.

"What-" Hana started, but her voice cut off as the first arc of lightning crackled into existence.

It wasn't like anything Evory had imagined.

Lightning, in her experience, was quick, a flash and gone, leaving only the afterimage on your retinas. But this was different. This was *sustained*. Ribbons of electric current spiraled out from Mizuki's body, coiling around her like living things, dancing between her fingers and racing along her arms.

She raised one hand toward a reinforced training dummy across the floor.

The lightning struck.

Not a bolt, a beam. A concentrated lance of electrical fury that crossed the distance in a fraction of a heartbeat and *vaporized* the upper half of the dummy. The sound was deafening: a crack-boom that rattled Evory's teeth and left her ears ringing despite the suppression systems kicking in.

The afterimage lingered in her vision. Blue-white. Branching. Wrong.

Power at this level wasn't supposed to be beautiful. But it was.

Mizuki's arm dropped, and the lightning faded to a constant crackle around her body. Her eyes were still glowing, but dimmer now, a sustained charge rather than full output.

"Continue," Honda said. His voice was calm. Professional. As if he'd just asked someone to demonstrate a particularly tricky math problem.

Mizuki moved.

What followed was less an exercise and more a demonstration. She destroyed training targets with surgical precision, some with focused bolts, others with wide-area discharges that left scorch marks on the reinforced floor. She moved through the obstacle course not by avoiding obstacles but by *removing* them, electricity arcing ahead of her to disable barriers before she reached them.

At one point, she paused in the center of the floor and raised both hands toward the ceiling.

The lights flickered.

Every light in the training complex flickered simultaneously, and for one terrifying moment, Evory thought the power was going to fail entirely. But then the flicker stabilized, and she realized what was happening.

Mizuki was drawing power from the grid.

The ambient lighting dimmed as energy flowed toward her, channeled through paths that only she could perceive. The crackling around her body intensified. The air itself seemed to vibrate.

And then she released it.

The discharge wasn't aimed at anything. It was simply *released*, a hemisphere of electrical force that expanded outward from Mizuki's position, washing over the training floor like a shockwave. Evory felt it pass through her despite the distance: a tingling, bone-deep sensation that made her entire body twitch involuntarily.

Every training dummy in the room was charred.

Every electronic display had reset.

The suppression systems were screaming alarms.

And Mizuki Kaminari was standing in the center of it all, her eyes still glowing, her expression unchanged.

*This is Rank 9*, Evory thought. *This is what it means to be a world-altering variable.*

---

"That's enough."

Honda's voice cut through the noise of the alarms. He was standing on the observation deck, his posture as controlled as ever, but there was something in his expression that might have been concern.

Mizuki's glow faded. The crackling around her body diminished, then vanished. She lowered her hands to her sides and stood there, breathing steadily, looking almost exactly the same as she had before the demonstration.

Almost.

Evory noticed it because she was watching so closely. The slight tremor in Mizuki's left hand. The way her shoulders had tightened almost imperceptibly. The too-careful quality of her breathing, controlled, yes, but controlled in the way of someone actively preventing something from going wrong.

The cost. Dr. Tanaka's lecture echoed in Evory's mind. *Every oddity has a cost.*

"Assessment complete," Honda said. "Kaminari, report to Medical Wing for post-exercise monitoring. Everyone else, ten-minute break, then we resume with tactical scenarios."

Mizuki nodded once and turned toward the exit.

She didn't look at anyone.

She didn't speak.

She simply walked off the training floor with those same controlled movements, her tail swaying behind her in a slow rhythm, and disappeared through the doors that led toward the Medical Wing.

The bubble of space followed her all the way.

---

Evory lasted three minutes before she made her decision.

"I'll be right back," she told Hana, who was still staring at the scorch marks on the training floor with wide eyes.

"What? Where are you-"

But Evory was already moving, slipping through the cluster of students and heading for the same exit Mizuki had used.

She told herself it was curiosity. She told herself it was concern. She told herself a lot of things as she navigated the corridor that connected the Training Complex to the Medical Wing.

The truth was simpler.

She'd seen something during that demonstration. Not just the power, everyone had seen the power. What she'd seen was the aftermath. The tremor. The too-careful breathing. The way Mizuki had walked off the floor like someone carrying a weight no one else could see.

*The cost is not something you want to understand*, Mizuki had said in the cafeteria.

But Evory was starting to think she wanted to understand anyway.

---

The Medical Wing was quieter than the Training Complex, sterile and calm, with the particular hush of a place designed for recovery. Evory moved carefully through the entrance corridor, trying not to look like she was sneaking.

She wasn't sneaking. She was just... walking. In a direction that happened to lead to where Mizuki might be.

The main treatment area was visible through a glass partition: several beds arranged along one wall, monitoring equipment humming softly, a few staff members moving between stations. A woman in medical scrubs was consulting a tablet near the central desk, Dr. Mei Chen, Evory assumed, based on the descriptions she'd heard.

And in the far corner, sitting on the edge of a treatment bed with electrodes attached to her temples, was Mizuki.

Her eyes were closed. Her expression was the same neutral mask as always. But something about her posture was different, less controlled, more... tired. The electrodes connected to a monitoring station that displayed patterns Evory couldn't interpret.

Dr. Chen was saying something, her voice too low to hear through the partition. Mizuki responded with minimal words, never opening her eyes.

Evory stood in the corridor, watching through the glass, and felt the weight of what she was witnessing settle over her.

*This happens every time*, she realized. *Every time she uses her power at that level, she comes here. Every time, she sits in that bed while they measure what it cost her.*

The monitors displayed something that made Dr. Chen frown. She said something else, more emphatic this time from the look of things. Mizuki's response was a mere shake of her head.

Even from here, Evory could see the exhaustion. Not physical, Mizuki's body was still, controlled, the same as always. But there was something behind the mask now. Something that looked almost like resignation.

*How many times?* Evory wondered. *How many times has she sat there, alone, while someone measures the damage?*

The answer, she suspected, was: every time. Every training session. Every demonstration. Every moment when someone needed to be reminded what a Rank 9 could do.

And afterward, every time, she came here alone.

No one checking on her. No one sitting in the waiting area. No one treating this as anything other than routine maintenance on a dangerous piece of equipment.

Evory's hands clenched at her sides.

She knew she should leave. This wasn't her business. Mizuki had made it clear that she preferred her isolation, and Evory had no right to intrude on what was clearly a private moment.

But she didn't leave.

Instead, she found a chair in the corridor, one of the generic waiting room seats placed there for exactly this purpose, and sat down.

She didn't enter the Medical Wing proper. She didn't approach the treatment bed or interrupt the monitoring. She just... stayed.

Within sight of the glass partition.

Close enough that if Mizuki opened her eyes and looked toward the corridor, she would see her.

It wasn't much. It wasn't an intrusion or a demand or an offer of help. It was just presence. The simple statement: *I'm here. I saw what it cost you. I'm not pretending it didn't happen.*

The monitoring continued for another fifteen minutes.

When Dr. Chen finally removed the electrodes and said something that sounded like dismissal, Mizuki opened her eyes.

She didn't look toward the corridor immediately. She gathered herself with those careful, controlled movements, rolling her shoulders, flexing her fingers, testing her body's responses like someone reassessing a familiar piece of machinery.

But then, as she stood to leave, her gaze drifted toward the glass partition.

Silver met pink.

Evory didn't wave. Didn't smile. Didn't do any of the things she normally did when making contact. She just held Mizuki's gaze and stayed exactly where she was.

A second passed. Two.

Mizuki's expression didn't change. But something flickered behind her eyes, surprise, maybe, or confusion. The same response she'd shown in the cafeteria when Evory had sat at her table uninvited.

*Why are you here?*

Evory didn't have a good answer. Not one she could articulate. But the question felt less like a challenge this time and more like genuine bewilderment.

Then Mizuki turned and walked toward the Medical Wing's exit, which meant walking past the corridor where Evory was sitting.

She stopped at the threshold.

"You shouldn't be here," Mizuki said quietly. Her voice was rougher than usual, the rasp more pronounced. "The training session isn't over."

"Honda gave us a ten-minute break." Evory's voice was steady despite her hammering heart. "I had time."

"Time for what?"

The question hung between them.

Evory considered her answer carefully. There were a lot of things she could say, I was worried, I wanted to see if you were okay, I can't stop thinking about you. All of them true. All of them probably wrong for this moment.

Instead, she said: "Time to sit."

Mizuki stared at her.

"That's not an answer."

"I know."

Another silence. The Medical Wing hummed softly behind them. Dr. Chen had returned to her tablet, apparently content to let this strange interaction play out without interference.

Mizuki's tail twitched, the same barely-perceptible movement Evory had noticed in the cafeteria. A tell she probably didn't know she had.

"You're strange," Mizuki said finally.

"I've been told."

"Most people stay away after they see what I can do."

Evory tilted her head, her bunny ears shifting with the motion. "I'm not most people."

"No." Mizuki's silver eyes studied her with that same calculating intensity. "You're not."

She turned and walked away, her boots making soft sounds against the Medical Wing floor, her tail trailing behind her.

But at the corridor intersection, she paused.

"The break is almost over," she said without looking back. "You'll be late if you don't hurry."

And then she was gone.

Evory sat in the corridor for another thirty seconds, processing what had just happened.

It wasn't a conversation. Not really. But it was something.

*She noticed I was there. She acknowledged it. She didn't tell me to leave.*

Small progress. Barely visible.

But it was enough.

Evory stood, stretched her legs, and started making her way back to the Training Complex.

She had tactical scenarios to get back to. She had classmates to train with. She had a whole Vanguard Program to survive.

But somewhere in the back of her mind, a new thought had taken root.

*She's alone because everyone stays away after they see her power. But what if someone didn't? What if someone saw it and stayed anyway?*

The thought felt important. It felt like the beginning of something.

Evory's ears perked forward as she walked, and despite the exhaustion already settling into her muscles, she was smiling.

---

That evening, back in her dorm room, Evory lay on her bed and stared at the ceiling.

The training session had continued for another three hours after the break. Honda had run them through tactical scenarios, team exercises where they had to coordinate their oddities to achieve objectives. Evory had partnered with Hana and two other first-years, their combined abilities barely adequate for the challenges thrown at them.

She was exhausted. Her muscles ached in ways she hadn't experienced since her earliest days of oddity training back in California. The elastic fibers in her legs were protesting loudly, demanding rest and recovery time.

But her mind wouldn't stop spinning.

*Rank 9.*

She'd known, abstractly, what that meant. Hana had told her. Dr. Tanaka's lectures had explained the scale. But knowing and *seeing* were different things entirely.

Mizuki had reshaped the training floor with a thought. Had drawn power from the building's electrical grid like someone taking a sip of water. Had demonstrated capabilities that made Evory's carefully practiced agility look like a children's game.

The power gap wasn't just large.

It was incomprehensible.

*What do I even offer?* The thought crept in uninvited. *What could I possibly contribute to someone who can do... that?*

She pushed the thought aside. It wasn't useful. It wasn't the point.

The point was the aftermath. The tremor. The Medical Wing. The electrodes and the monitoring and the tired resignation behind Mizuki's eyes.

The point was that Mizuki had seen her waiting in the corridor, and instead of anger or dismissal, there had been something that looked almost like confusion. Like she couldn't quite understand why someone would be there.

*Most people stay away after they see what I can do.*

But Evory hadn't stayed away. She'd walked toward it. Sat with it. Waited.

And Mizuki had noticed.

The plush bunny was tucked under Evory's arm, its floppy ears pressing against her shoulder. Ridiculous. Comforting. A piece of home in a room that still felt foreign.

"I'm going to figure this out," she told the bunny. "I don't know how yet. But I'm going to figure it out."

The bunny, predictably, offered no advice.

Evory smiled despite herself and closed her eyes.

Tomorrow there would be more training. More lessons. More opportunities to be reminded exactly how outclassed she was by the students around her.

But there would also be more opportunities to show up. To be present. To chip away at the isolation that surrounded Mizuki Kaminari like a force field.

That was enough for now.

Sleep came easier than expected, and in her dreams, lightning danced across the sky while she leaped from cloud to cloud, trying to catch up with something that seemed to always stay just out of reach.
