# Chapter 2 ,  First Words

The alarm on Evory's student terminal went off at 7:30, and she spent the first three seconds of consciousness wondering why her ceiling was the wrong color.

Then reality caught up with her: Japan. Aomi City. The Academy. She was nine thousand kilometers away from home, lying in a dorm room that still smelled vaguely of cleaning solution and new furniture.

Her bunny ears twitched involuntarily, catching the muffled sounds of other students moving through the hallway outside. Footsteps. Doors. The mundane symphony of morning routines.

She sat up slowly, her body still heavy with jet lag. The plush bunny sat on the pillow next to her, looking slightly accusatory.

"Don't judge me," she mumbled, swinging her legs over the side of the bed. "It was a long flight."

The morning routine was functional if not elegant: shower, dress, check the terminal for her schedule. First class at nine, Power Theory with Dr. Yuki Tanaka, Room 301 in the Main Academic Building. She had forty-five minutes to find food and navigate to a building she'd only seen from outside.

Plenty of time. Probably.

Evory chose her outfit with intention: a pastel blue skirt layered over white leggings, a cropped sweater in soft yellow, and her signature cascade of accessories. The look was loud by Japanese standards, which was precisely the point. If people were going to stare at her ears anyway, they might as well have something else to focus on.

She left her room at 8:15, joining the flow of students heading toward the cafeteria.

---

Breakfast was less intimidating than yesterday's dinner had been. The early morning crowd was smaller and more focused on caffeine than social dynamics. Evory grabbed rice, miso soup, and a piece of fish that she hoped was salmon, then found a table near the windows where the morning light spilled across the floor.

She ate quickly, one eye on her terminal's map. Room 301 was on the third floor of the Main Academic Building, east wing. The route seemed straightforward enough.

As she was finishing her soup, she caught herself scanning the cafeteria again. Looking for, 

*Her.*

The shark girl from last night. The one everyone avoided.

But the tables near the far wall were empty now. No creepy teeth, no silver eyes, no controlled stillness that somehow filled more space than any mvement would have.

Evory felt an odd pang of disappointment, which she immediately dismissed as ridiculous. She wasn't going to solve the mystery of the lonely shark girl over breakfast on her second day. That wasn't how anything worked.

She finished her meal, discarded her tray, and headed for class.

---

Room 301 was a lecture hall with tiered seating, large windows, and the particular silence of a space waiting to be filled with knowledge. Evory arrived ten minutes early and found roughly half the seats already occupied.

The students were a mix of first-years like herself and what she assumed were second-years, older, more settled, carrying themselves with the confidence of people who already knew how everything worked and didn't really need to be here. She spotted visible mutations scattered throughout the room: scales, unusual coloring, limbs that bent at angles human limbs shouldn't bend (lol hi ellie). But also plenty of students who looked entirely ordinary, their oddities presumably internal or invisible.

She chose a seat in the middle of the room, not too eager in the front, not hiding in the back. A good position for observation.

More students filtered in over the next few minutes. A girl with dark purple hair in twin tails sat two rows ahead, chatting animatedly with the boy whose shadow seemed to move independently of his body she caught a glimpse of the day prior. A cluster of second-years settled into the back corner, speaking in low voices.

And then, 

Evory's ears perked up before her brain registered why.

The shark girl walked through the door.

She moved with that same controlled efficiency Evory had noticed in the cafeteria, every step measured, every gesture economical. Her oversized black hoodie had clearly been modified to accommodate the dorsal fin rising from her back, and her tail trailed behind her, thick and muscular and covered in that rough, abrasive skin.

She didn't look at anyone.

No one looked at her.

The social choreography was so smooth that it almost seemed natural. Students shifted subtly in their seats, conversations adjusted their volumes, attention found convenient other directions. A bubble of space formed around her as she climbed the tiered steps and settled into a seat at the far end of the back row.

Alone.

As far from everyone else as the room's geometry would allow.

Evory watched her pull out a tablet and place it on the desk with precise, unhurried movements. Her expression was neutral, not hostile, not sad, just *present* in a way that somehow felt like absence.

*Who are you?*

The question from last night resurfaced, sharper now. Not *what* was she, that was obvious, or at least visible. But *who* was this person who inhabited such complete isolation?

Before Evory could pursue the thought, a woman in her mid-forties entered the room.

Dr. Yuki Tanaka had the particular elegance of someone who had spent decades being taken seriously. Gray-streaked black hair worn in a neat bun. Thin-framed glasses over sharp brown eyes. A white lab coat over professional attire. She carried herself like someone who knew things, and knew that knowing things mattered.

"Good morning," she said, her voice carrying easily through the hall. "I am Dr. Tanaka. This is Power Theory, and you are either in the right place or about to have an educational experience you didn't anticipate."

A ripple of nervous laughter moved through the first-years.

Dr. Tanaka set her tablet on the podium and surveyed the room with the calm efficiency of someone cataloging data points. Her gaze lingered briefly on Evory, the ears, the outfit, the obvious foreignness, then moved on without comment.

"Before we begin," she continued, "let me establish some ground rules. This course exists because oddities exist. They are biological. They are measurable. They are, within certain parameters, predictable. But they are not fully understood."

She tapped her tablet, and the room's display screen lit up with a simple question:

**What is the cost of power?**

"This is the question that will define your time at AIA," Dr. Tanaka said. "Not 'What can you do?' or 'How strong are you?' Those questions are for children and journalists. The question that matters, the question that will keep you alive, is this one."

She turned to face the class directly.

"Every oddity has a cost. Physical strain. Psychological erosion. Biological degradation. The relationship between power and consequence is not linear, but it is absolute. There are no exceptions."

Evory found herself leaning forward, ears tilted toward the professor. This wasn't what she'd expected from a first lecture. No welcome to the program, no overview of the syllabus. Just this: hard truth delivered without padding.

"By the end of this course," Dr. Tanaka continued, "you will understand what your oddity costs you. Not in the abstract. Not in theory. You will know the specific mechanisms by which your power erodes your body and mind. And you will learn what it means to manage that cost."

She paused, letting the words settle.

"Some of you will find this uncomfortable. Good. Discomfort is where learning lives."

Her gaze swept the room again, and this time Evory could have sworn it lingered for an extra moment on the back row.

On that shark girl sitting alone.

"Now," Dr. Tanaka said, "let's begin."

---

The lecture was dense, fascinating, and slightly terrifying.

Dr. Tanaka walked them through the basics of oddity mechanics: the neuro-organic formations that appeared in oddity bearers, the way those structures seemed to bridge the gap between conscious intent and physical effect, the ongoing mystery of why some manifestations were more powerful than others.

She explained the cost framework, the different consequences that had been studied over the past two decades to categorize and predict the damage different oddity types inflicted on their bearers. Physical costs were the most visible: muscle strain, joint degradation, internal injuries. But the deeper costs were psychological: dissociation, identity fragmentation, the erosion of the boundary between human and power.

"The greater the power, " Dr. Tanaka said, "the heavier the toll. This is not a metaphor. This is factual, biological."

She displayed brain scans on the screen, before and after images of oddity bearers who had pushed their powers too far. The differences were subtle to Evory's untrained eye, but the professor's narration made the implications clear: parts of the brain that should have been one color were another. Structures that should have been solid were fragmented.

"Long-term, high-output oddity use creates measurable changes in neural architecture," Dr. Tanaka explained. "We do not fully understand these changes. We do not know if they are reversible. We do not know what happens as oddity bearers age, because the oldest confirmed bearer is twenty-six years old."

She let that hang in the air for a moment.

"You are all experiments. Every one of you. The difference between you and a lab rat is that you get to take notes."

Evory's ears flattened involuntarily. The professor's delivery was clinical, almost detached, but the content was deeply personal. She was an oddity bearer. She manifested at nine. Her springjump ability had felt like a gift, a cool thing she could do, an advantage in a world that often felt hostile.

She had never thought of it as something eating her from the inside.

Her gaze drifted again to the back row.

The shark girl, Evory still didn't know her name, was writing something on her tablet. Her expression hadn't changed throughout the lecture, but there was something in the angle of her shoulders, the way her tail curled slightly against the modified chair, that suggested she was listening carefully.

Of course she was. If anyone in this room understood the cost of power, it was probably her.

---

Class ended at 10:30 Students filed out in the usual post-lecture shuffle, conversations resuming, plans being made, the social machinery of campus life slowly settling back into motion after summer break.

Evory gathered her things slowly, her mind still processing the lecture's content. The girl with the purple hair, Hana, she thought she remembered from the attendance, was lingering near the door, chatting with another first-year.

In the back row, the shark girl was packing up her tablet with the same deliberate movements she used for everything. She didn't look at anyone. She didn't seem to expect anyone to look at her.

At that moment... Evory made a decision.

She gathered her courage, stood up, and walked toward the back of the room.

The social barrier was almost physical. Other students instinctively stepped aside as she passed, creating a clear path while pretending not to. By the time she reached the back row, she was very aware of how many people were carefully *not* watching.

The shark girl looked up as Evory approached.

Silver eyes met pink.

Up close, the details were sharper. The rows of teeth visible even with her mouth closed. The slight roughness of the skin along her jawline that wasn't quite human texture. The way her ears were ever so slightly pointed, way more subtle than Evory's but definitely not standard.

She was striking. Not beautiful in a conventional way, not pretty or cute or any of the comfortable adjectives. Striking. Like lightning, or the edge of a cliff, or something else that demanded attention whether you wanted to give it or not.

"Hi, " Evory said, her voice bright and slightly louder than necessary. "I'm Evory. Evory Hale. I'm a first-year. I just transferred from California, actually, well, transferred isn't quite right, more like enrolled? It's my first time studying abroad, and-"

She was rambling. She could hear herself rambling. The shark girl's expression hadn't changed.

"A-anyway, I noticed you in the cafeteria last night, and I thought maybe we could-"

"Why?"

The word cut through Evory's words like a blade.

The shark girl's voice was lower than Evory had expected, with a slight rasp that might have been natural or might have been from lack of usage. Her expression remained neutral, but her silver eyes were fixed on Evory with an intensity that felt like being measured.

"Why what?" Evory blinked.

"Why did you approach me."

It wasn't really a question. More like a demand for justification.

Evory's ears twitched. She was suddenly very aware of the empty seats around them, the sort of safety distance the rest of the class had maintained, the careful way everyone was still not-watching.

"Because you were sitting alone," she said finally. "And I'm new here. And..."

She trailed off, realizing she didn't have a good ending for that sentence.

The shark girl studied her for a long moment. Then she stood, gathering her bag with those precise, economical movements.

"I sit alone because I prefer to."

"Oh." Evory blinked. "Okay. That's fair. I just thought-"

"You thought wrong."

There was no anger in the words. No hostility. Just a flat statement of fact, delivered with the same neutrality as everything else.

The shark girl turned and walked toward the side exit, her tail trailing behind her in a slow sweep.

Evory watched her go.

She should have felt discouraged. Should have felt embarrassed, maybe, or rejected. The social calculus was clear: approach made, approach rejected, interaction over.

But somehow, all she felt was curious.

*She said she preferred to sit alone. Not that she wanted to.*

There was a difference there. Evory wasn't sure what it meant yet, but there was definitely a difference.

---

Lunch found Evory in the cafeteria, sitting at a table near the middle of the room with a tray of food she hadn't really looked at.

Her ears tracked movement throughout the alleys as she ate, but her attention kept drifting to one specific corner.

The shark girl was there. Same table as last night, far wall, empty seats surrounding her, a perfect radius of social distance maintained but unspoken. She was eating slowly, methodically, her gaze fixed on her tray.

Evory watched her for several minutes, trying to decide what to do.

The lecture had shifted something in her thinking. *Every oddity has a cost.* She looked at the shark girl, at the dorsal fin, the tail, the teeth, and wondered what it cost to be that terrifying. What it cost to be that visible. What kind of power caused you to sit alone in a room full of people who were supposed to understand what it meant to be different.

"You're staring."

Evory jumped. The girl with the purple hair, Hana, had appeared at her elbow, tray in hand, expression somewhere between curious and concerned.

"I wasn't-" Evory started, then stopped. Lying seemed pointless. "Okay, I was staring a little. Do you know who she is?"

Hana glanced toward the far wall, then back at Evory with an expression of mild disbelief. "You don't know?"

"I'm new. I don't know a lot of things."

"That's Mizuki Kaminari." Hana said the name like it should mean something. "Second-year Vanguard. Rank 9. She's like..." Hana paused, searching for words. "She's the most powerful students at the Academy. Maybe in the country."

*Rank 9.* Evory's brain supplied the context from Dr. Tanaka's lecture. The power scale went from 1 to 10, but 10 was theoretical, no confirmed cases. Rank 9 was labeled as "world-altering variable." The kind of power that could reshape geography if left unchecked.

"And everyone avoids her because...?"

Hana sat down across from Evory, her expression shifting to something more complicated. "She's not... mean, exactly. She's just... a lot. Her oddity is lightning, but like, *really* lightning. She can feel electrical fields, and she's constantly generating power, and when she uses it..."

She trailed off, her own ears, normal human ears, Evory noted with a twinge of envy, slightly red.

"I heard she caused a blackout once. During a training exercise. Knocked out power to half the campus for an hour." Hana's voice dropped lower. "And that was her holding back."

Evory processed this. "So people stay away because they're scared of her."

"Wouldn't you be?"

The question hung in the air between them.

Evory thought about it. Thought about the silver eyes and the controlled movements and the way Mizuki had said *I sit alone because I prefer to* with no emotion whatsoever.

"No," she said finally. "I don't think I would."

Hana stared at her like she'd just announced she was carrying a bomb.

"You're weird," she said, but not unkindly. "I'm Hana, by the way. Hana Yoshida. First-year, Rank 4. Sonic emission, I can do the sound thing." She wiggled her fingers in a vague illustrative gesture. "You're the American, right? The bunny girl?"

"Guilty." Evory smiled, grateful for the change of subject. "Evory Hale. SpringJump, I can jump really high and bounce off things."

"Cool." Hana's expression brightened. "Want to eat together? I can fill you in on everything you need to know. Like which professors are actually helpful and which ones just like hearing themselves talk. And which cafeteria stations to avoid. And-" She glanced toward the far wall again. "-which students you should probably not try to befriend."

Evory followed her gaze to Mizuki's table.

The shark girl was still eating alone. Still not looking at anyone. Still occupying that perfect bubble of isolation.

"Yeah," Evory said slowly. "Let's eat together. But..." She looked back at Hana. "Maybe you could tell me more about her? Shark lady?"

Hana's expression flickered through several emotions too quickly to read. "You're really not going to let this go, are you?"

"Probably not."

"Okay." Hana sighed, but there was something almost like admiration in her voice. "But don't say I didn't warn you."

---

By the time lunch ended, Evory had learned the basics.

Mizuki Kaminari. Nineteen years old, second-year. Her oddity had manifested early, earlier than most, which was apparently significant. She'd been placed at the Academy through "direct recommendation," which Hana explained was polite terminology for "too dangerous to say no to."

Her power was lightning. Pure, overwhelming electrical generation. She could absorb energy from around her, amplify it internally, and discharge it in controlled bursts, or uncontrolled ones if pushed. Her eyes glowed white when she used her power, and the air around her changed. Static. Pressure. The sense of something vast barely held in place.

She had no friends that anyone knew of. No social connections that extended beyond functional necessity. She trained alone, ate alone, lived alone in a modified dorm room somewhere in a more secure wing of the dorms.

"She's not cruel," Hana had said, picking at her food. "I've never seen her be actually mean to anyone. She just... doesn't connect. Or can't. Or won't. Nobody really knows."

Evory had nodded, storing away every detail.

Now, as the cafeteria emptied for afternoon activities, she was still sitting at her table. Watching.

Mizuki was finishing her meal with that same methodical precision. Her tray was almost empty now, the dishes stacked with military neatness.

Aaand, Evory made another decision.

She stood up, ignored Hana's quiet "where are you going?" and walked across the cafeteria.

The bubble of social distance rippled as she approached, students at nearby tables glancing up, conversations pausing, that same choreography of pretending not to notice. But Evory was committed now. She kept walking until she reached Mizuki's table.

And then, without asking permission, she sat down.

Across from Mizuki. Close enough to touch. Inside the invisible barrier that everyone else maintained.

Mizuki's silver eyes lifted slowly from her tray.

The silence stretched between them.

Evory's heart was hammering against her chest, but she kept her expression bright, her posture open. This was either going to work or it was going to fail spectacularly, one way or another... she was going to find out.

"Hi again," she said. "I know you said you prefer to sit alone and stuff. But I figured I'd give you the chance to tell me twice."

Mizuki stared at her.

The silence continued.

Evory's ears twitched. She could feel the attention of the entire cafeteria pressing against her back, people watching without watching, listening without listening. She didn't care. *Let them watch.*

"You are persistent," Mizuki said finally.

Her voice was still flat, still had that same low rasp. But there was something different in it now, a flicker of something that might have been curiosity, it was quickly suppressed.

"I've been told that." Evory smiled. "Usually as a criticism."

"It is."

"Maybe." Evory tilted her head with a light shrug, studying Mizuki's face for any reaction. "Or maybe persistence is just another word for not giving up on people."

Another silence. Mizuki's expression remained neutral, but her tail twitched slightly, a movement so small Evory almost missed it.

"I don't need-" Mizuki started.

"I know." Evory cut her off gently. "You don't need me to sit here. You don't need anyone to sit here. That's not why I'm here."

"Then why?"

It was the same question as before. But delivered differently this time, less demand, more genuine confusion.

Evory considered her answer carefully.

"Because you looked interesting," she said finally. "And because everyone else is acting like you're something to be afraid of. And I just spent an hour learning about how every oddity has a cost, and I'm sitting here wondering what the cost is for you."

Mizuki's expression flickered. Just for a moment, barely a fraction of a second, something crossed her face that looked almost like surprise.

Then the neutral mask returned.

"The cost," Mizuki said slowly, "is not something you want to understand."

"That's not a no."

Mizuki stared at her. Her silver eyes were unreadable, but Evory had the sudden sense that she was being evaluated, weighed, measured, catalogued like one of Dr. Tanaka's data points.

Then Mizuki stood.

She gathered her tray with those precise movements, stacked her dishes, and turned toward the return station.

Evory's heart sank slightly. Rejected again. The pattern was clear, 

"Kaminari."

Evory blinked. "What?"

Mizuki paused, not quite looking back over her shoulder. Her voice was quiet, almost lost in the ambient noise of the cafeteria.

"My name. Mizuki Kaminari."

And then she walked away.

Evory sat at the empty table, surrounded by the remnants of a conversation that had barely been a conversation at all, and felt something warm bloom in her chest.

*She told me her name.*

It wasn't much. It wasn't an invitation, or an opening, or anything that would look like progress from the outside.

But it was something. And something she could cling to.

Evory smiled, gathered her own things, and left the cafeteria with a spring in her step that had nothing to do with her oddity.

---

That evening, lying in her dorm room with the lights off and the plush bunny tucked under her arm, Evory stared at the ceiling and replayed the moment.

*Mizuki Kaminari.*

The name had a weight to it. Lightning in Japanese, according to the quick search she'd done on her terminal. Fitting, given her power. (who tf names these characters jeez)

*She said she prefers to sit alone. But she told me her name anyway.*

The cafeteria had been buzzing after their exchange. Hana had cornered her outside almost immediately after she left, demanding details with an intensity that bordered on alarm. "You actually sat at her table? You *talked* to her? What did she say?"

Evory had been vague in her answers. Partly because the exchange had been too brief to summarize meaningfully. Partly because it felt private, somehow, a moment that wasn't meant to be shared with anyone else.

Now, in the quiet of her room, she let herself think about what came next.

*She's not going to make this easy.* That was obvious. Mizuki had walls, built from years of isolation and the weight of power that most people couldn't comprehend. She wasn't going to lower them because some American first-year with bunny ears decided to be persistent.

But Evory wasn't going to stop.

Not because she thought she could fix Mizuki, or save her, or any of the hero-fantasy narratives that populated the stories she'd grown up reading. Those were for people who thought power meant strength and isolation meant weakness.

No. She was going to keep showing up because Mizuki had looked at her today. Had engaged with her, even briefly. Had given her a name when she didn't have to.

And because underneath all the walls and the silence and the careful control, Evory had seen something flicker. Something that clearly looked like loneliness. A feeling that seemed to be forced upon Mizuki because of her nature alone.

*I know that feeling,* she thought. *I know what it's like to be different in a room full of people who don't know what to do with you.*

The difference was that Evory had learned to fight it with color and noise and relentless optimism. Mizuki had learned to fight it by building walls.

Maybe there was a middle ground?

Maybe there was a version of their story where the shark girl and the bunny girl learned how to be alone together?

Evory smiled in the darkness, her ears twitching softly against the pillow.

*Tomorrow,* she promised herself. *I'll find her again tomorrow.*

Sleep came easier that night. And in her dreams, the ocean was quiet, and somewhere beneath the waves, a current hummed.
