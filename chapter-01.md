# Chapter 1 - Arrival

The train slowed and curved along the coastline, Evory Hale pressed her forehead against the glass like a child and observed the unfamiliar landscape that was appearing in front of her.

Outside, the Pacific Ocean stretched endlessly, its surface catching the afternoon light and bouncing it back in golden rays. The water looked different here somehow. Calmer than the California beaches she knew, the waves rolling in with an almost meditative rhythm. She hadn't seen the ocean in actual weeks. The journey from Los Angeles to Tokyo, the layover at the airport then the second train south... All of it had kept her landlocked and anxious.

But at last here it was: the sea. And, beyond the shoreline, rising from behind the slopes of the hills, the anticipated [[world-bible/places/aomi-city/aomi-city.md|Aomi City]].

Evory's bunny ears perked forward involuntarily, twitching as she scanned the approaching skyline. The city wasn't what she'd expected. In her mind, she'd built something more institutional: gray buildings, security checkpoints, the architecture of containment dressed up as education. The articles she'd read online hadn't helped. *"Where Japan sends its most dangerous."* *"The city that accepts what other cities refuse."* *"A containment strategy disguised as a university."*

But Aomi didn't really look like any of that.

Wide pedestrian avenues lined with trees flowed between buildings that prioritized glass and natural light. Green corridors connected major districts, and the overall impression was less "institution" and more "someone designed a city and actually wanted people to live in it." The architecture felt modern but warm. Soft. Almost gentle, maybe even pleasant.

The only hints of something different were subtle: the reinforced edges of rooftops, the occasional tower that didn't quite match the aesthetic, the way certain buildings seemed built lower and wider than they needed to be.

Load-bearing, Evory thought. For weight. For impact.

Her reflection in the train window caught her eye, white bunny ears rising above white hair, her eyes studying the city with an intensity she hadn't intended. She looked like something from an anime, which had been funny back in California and was probably less amusing here. Japan had enough anime-adjacent aesthetics without some American girl showing up looking like a mascot.

Not that she could help it. This was just who she was.

The train's intercom announced their arrival in Japanese, and Evory fumbled through the translation in her head. Her Japanese was okay(ish), she'd been studying intensively for two years, and even with that... train announcements still sounded like someone had blended all the syllables together and hit play at 1.5x speed.

She stood, adjusting her backpack and smoothing down her layered pastel outfit. Gyaru-inspired, bold even by Californian standards. Some of the other passengers had glanced at her during the ride: at the ears, at the clothes, at the general *loudness* of her existence. She was used to it. Fashion was armor. If people were going to stare anyway, she might as well give them something worth looking at.

The platform was clean and orderly, just like every other train platform she'd seen in Japan. A handful of other passengers disembarked, most of them looking as if they knew exactly where they were going. Students, probably. Some of them had visible mutations, a girl with faintly glowing veins along her arms, a boy whose shadow seemed to move independently of his body. No one stared at anyone else. That was the whole point here.

Evory took a breath, hoisted her bags, and stepped into Aomi City for the first time.

---

The walk from the station to the Academy took roughly fifteen minutes along a tree-lined pathway that felt more like a park than a city street. The afternoon's soft lighting reflecting on the ground guided her forward, and filtered through leaves that rustled with the ocean breeze.

Other students passed her going both directions: some in casual clothes, others in what looked like training gear. A few nodded in her direction, probably recognizing she was a newcomer. Most didn't though. Everyone carried themselves with the particular exhaustion of people who knew classes were rapidly approaching.

Evory's ears tracked sounds she didn't even consciously register: footsteps, conversations, the distant hum of what might have been machinery or might have been something else entirely. Her oddity wasn't auditory, but the bunny physiology came with certain perks, whether it was a curse or a blessing was unsure right now.

When the Academy finally came into view, she stopped.

The main academic building rose five stories, its facade, made out of glass and steel, reflecting the surrounding omnipresent greenery. Covered walkways connected it to other structures: what looked like dormitories to the left, a larger complex further back that seemed to be the training facilities from what Evory remembered from the documentation she'd read and seen. A central plaza spread before the main entrance, dotted with students sitting on benches, chatting, reading, just existing.

It looked like a university.

A very reinforced university, if you knew what to look for, but... a university nonetheless.

Evory exhaled slowly. This was it. Two years of applications, essays, tests, and waiting. One long- **too** long flight. And now she was standing in front of the place that had been her goal since she first learned it existed.

*A place for people like me.*

Her ears twitched again, and she forced herself to keep moving.

---

The orientation office was located on the second floor of the main building it was well indicated but by the time Evory found it, she was almost late. Almost. Not quite. She'd learned that lesson back in middle school: if you're gonna be the weird kid, at least be the punctual weird kid.

The door was open, revealing a compact office with a desk, several filing cabinets, and a man who looked as if he had been designed by a committee to embody the "reliable administrator."

Tall and lean, with gray temples and the kind of angular features that suggested he'd been stern even as a baby. He was reviewing something on a tablet when she knocked on the doorframe, and when he looked up, his expression was neutral in the particular way of people who processed information before displaying emotion.

"Evory Hale?" His speech was clear and measured, with just enough English inflection on her name to suggest he'd read her file.

"Yes! That's me." She caught herself speaking too quickly and slowed down. "I'm here for orientation. I uh, I hope I'm not late-"

"You're on time." He stood, gesturing toward a chair across from his desk. "Please, sit. I'm Kenji Murakami, Vanguard Program Coordinator. Welcome to Aomi Integrated Academy."

Evory sat, her tail brushing awkwardly against the back of the chair. The chairs here were wide, accommodating, she realized. Built for people with unusual bodies.

Murakami settled back into his own chair and tapped something on his tablet. "You've had a long journey. California to Tokyo, then south to Aomi. Your Japanese is good?"

"I've been studying. It's... getting there."

"It will improve quickly here. Immersion is effective." He pulled up what was clearly her file on his tablet and scanned it briefly. "Evory Hale. Eighteen years old. Oddity manifestation at age nine: lagomorphic mutation with enhanced muscular elasticity. Rank 3. Vanguard entrance exam admission, no direct recommendation."

She nodded, trying not to bristle at the clinical recitation. "That's me."

"Rank 3 is respectable for entrance exam placement. The Vanguard Program is demanding... more so than many students anticipate. You understand what you've signed up for?"

"Crisis response training. Live simulations. Potential deployment in oddity-related incidents." She recited it back the way she'd memorized it from the countless documentation she has read. "I know it's dangerous."

"Dangerous and meaningful are not mutually exclusive." Murakami's expression didn't change, but something in his tone shifted slightly. "Many students come here with expectations of... heroism. The public image, the visibility, the recognition. Those expectations rarely survive the first semester. The question is whether the student survives alongside them."

Evory's ears flattened slightly, an involuntary tell she'd never managed to control. "I'm not here for recognition."

"No?"

"I'm here because-" She paused, trying to find words that wouldn't sound rehearsed. "Back home, being an oddity bearer meant being watched. Not in a dangerous way, just... constant awareness. Even when people were nice, there was always this distance. Like they were calculating risk factors in their heads every time I sneezed or something."

She took a breath. "I wanted to go someplace where distance wasn't the default. Somewhere I could be different and it would be the baseline instead of the exception."

Murakami studied her for a moment. His eyes were dark and tired, but not unkind.

"That's a reasonable answer," he said finally. "Whether AIA delivers on that expectation is something you'll discover for yourself. We are a community of exceptions, which creates its own hierarchies and distances. Power is still measured. Status is still perceived. The difference is that no one here will pretend you are normal."

"That sounds... honest."

"It is." He set his tablet down. "Let me give you the practical overview. Your dormitory is in the West Wing, room 118, single occupancy. Your class schedule will be delivered to your student terminal by tomorrow morning. First week is adjustment: campus familiarization, preliminary assessments, and registration completion. Formal Vanguard training begins the following week."

He pulled a folder from a drawer and slid it across the desk. "Map, student ID, emergency protocols, and dining schedule. The cafeteria serves until 8:30PM tonight. I recommend you eat before you collapse from exhaustion, it seems jet lag is not kind to new arrivals."

Evory took the folder, flipping it open to see the folded map on top. The campus was larger than she'd expected, but organized logically. Dormitories were clearly marked.

"Any questions?" Murakami asked.

A hundred, probably. But only one that seemed relevant right now.

"How do I find the other Vanguard students? First-years, I mean."

"You'll meet them tomorrow during orientation activities. For tonight, I suggest focusing on settling in. Your roommates-" He paused, checking something. "Correction. You have a single room. First-year Vanguard students are given private accommodations to reduce incident potential during adjustment periods."

"Incident potential?"

"New environments cause stress. Stress affects power control. Private rooms reduce variables." His tone was matter-of-fact. "It's a precaution, not a judgment."

Evory nodded slowly. She'd had her own incidents back in California, accidental jumps, a ceiling fan destroyed when she sneezed and launched herself four feet straight up. Nothing really dangerous, just embarrassing. But she understood the logic.

"Thank you, Murakami-san." She stood, clutching the folder. "I appreciate the welcome."

"Report to the main orientation hall at 9AM tomorrow. Building 1-A, ground floor. Don't be late."

"I won't be."

---

Room 118 was small but functional, and Evory spent the first twenty minutes just standing in the middle of it, breathing.

The walls were plain cream. The furniture was modular and sturdy, a bed, a desk, a closet, a small bathroom visible through an open door. A window faced west, showing a slice of green that must have been the campus park. The ceiling was higher than it needed to be, which made the space feel less cramped.

All her boxes had arrived ahead of her, stacked neatly near the closet.

She dropped her backpack on the bed and exhaled slowly.

*This is home now.*

It didn't feel like home yet. It felt like a hotel room waiting to be personalized, clean, safe, completely devoid of personality. But that was fine. She could fix that. She was good at fixing that.

She unpacked the essentials first: toiletries, phone charger, the stuffed bunny her mom had insisted she bring "for emergencies." The bunny was ridiculous, a white plush with floppy ears that matched her own, but holding it felt grounding. A small piece of home in a room on the other side of the world.

The clothes could wait until tomorrow. The decorations, the fairy lights, the photos... all of that could wait too.

Right now, she was hungry.

Murakami had said the cafeteria served until 8:30. It was already past 7. If she was going to eat, she needed to move.

Evory splashed water on her face, adjusted her ears in the mirror (not that she could actually adjust them, they kinda just did what they wanted), and headed outside.

---

The cafeteria was exactly what she'd imagined and at the same time nothing like it at all.

Architecturally, it was impressive: a large open hall with two-story windows that caught the last golden light of sunset. Food stations lined one wall, offering options that ranged from familiar (rice, grilled fish) to experimental (something brown and gooey that she decided to avoid). Tables of varying sizes filled the floor, and students clustered in the patterns that seemed universal to every dining hall everywhere, groups of friends, pairs in conversation, singles focused on their meals or their phones.

But the *composition* of those students was different.

A boy with scales along his forearms laughed at something his friend said. A girl with hair that seemed to float independently of gravity hunched over a textbook. A pair near the windows moved their hands in what might have been sign language or might have been some kind of power-based communication either way lights flickered between their fingertips as they "spoke".

No one was entirely human. Not in the way the outside world defined it at least.

Evory grabbed a tray and moved through the food line, selecting rice, miso soup, and a cutlet that looked relatively normal. Her Japanese held up well enough to thank the staff and navigate the payment terminal. Small victories, one step at a time.

Finding a seat was harder.

The social geography of the room was immediately apparent: certain tables were claimed, certain spaces were off-limits through some unspoken consensus, and the body language of various groups ranged from "we're friendly" to "do not approach". Evory had navigated cafeterias before, she knew the rules, but she was new here. She didn't have a group to default to.

She was scanning for an empty table when she saw *her*.

Near the far wall, alone at a table meant for four, sat a girl who looked like she'd walked out of an entirely different story.

Short and thin, dressed entirely in black: an oversized hoodie, ripped jeans, heavy combat boots that probably weighed more than Evory's entire outfit. Her hair was dark and loose, framing a face that was striking in its stillness. Silver eyes gazed at nothing in particular, focused inward rather than on the room around her.

But that wasn't what made Evory freeze mid-step.

It was the teeth.

Rows of dangerously sharp teeth, visible even through her neutral expression. And behind her, resting on the seat she wasn't using, was a thick, muscular tail that was covered in rough, abrasive skin that caught the light differently than anything human.

*Shark*, Evory's brain supplied (very insightful). *She has shark parts.*

The girl's mouth was closed, but when she reached for her cup, Evory caught a better glimpse of teeth. Rows of them. Razor sharp and predatory, nothing like human dentition.

She was terrifying.

And everyone in the cafeteria was giving her space.

Not obviously, no one was pointing or whispering, at least not that Evory could see. But the tables around her were empty. The foot traffic in that section was minimal. People walked past without looking, in that particular way of deliberately *not* looking that always meant the opposite.

The girl didn't seem to notice. Or maybe she'd stopped noticing long ago.

Evory stood there, tray in hand, watching this stranger eat alone in a room full of people who shared her fundamental condition, different, strange, other, and somehow managed to make her feel even more isolated.

Something in her chest tightened.

*That's not fair*, she thought. *That's not how it should work here.*

But she didn't move. Not yet. Because she was tired and jet-lagged and new, and approaching the one person the entire room had silently agreed to avoid felt like a pretty significant first-day decision.

Instead, she found an empty table near the windows, not too close, not too far, and sat down.

She ate slowly, stealing glances when she thought she could get away with it.

The shark girl finished her meal with methodical efficiency, stacked her dishes with the precision of someone who'd done it a thousand times, and rose to leave. Her movements were controlled, almost too careful, like someone constantly measuring the space they occupied.

When she walked past Evory's table, their eyes met for exactly one second.

Silver met pink.

No expression. No acknowledgment. Just a brief moment of contact before the girl looked away and kept walking.

Evory watched her leave through the cafeteria's back exit, tail swaying slightly behind her with each step.

Her ears twitched.

*Who are you?*

She didn't know yet. But she was sure going to find out.

---

That night, lying in her too-quiet room with the plush bunny tucked under one arm, Evory stared at the ceiling and replayed the moment.

Silver eyes. Sharp teeth. A tail that could probably knock someone off their feet if it swung too fast.

And the isolation? The way the entire room had organized itself around her absence. Evory had come to Aomi to escape that feeling. To find a place where being different was the baseline.

But apparently, even here, some people were more different than others.

She rolled onto her side, ears pressing awkwardly against the pillow.

*Tomorrow*, she decided. *Tomorrow, I'll ask someone who she is.*

Sleep came slowly, but it came. And in her dreams, the ocean stretched endlessly, and somewhere beneath the waves... something powerful moved without being seen.
