## Appearance

Evory looks like she stepped out of a completely different story.

Her oddity grants her a distinctly **lagomorphic mutation** (basically she got bunny features but said with fancy words), but unlike many physical oddities, it is clean and almost decorative in its restraint:

- **White bunny ears** rising from her head
- A small **white bunny tail** at her lower back
- No other fur coverage — the rest of her body remains human skin

 She is an **albino bunny oddity bearer**:
- **Hair:** White, long and flowy
- **Eyes:** Light pink (typical of albino lagomorphs)
- **Skin:** Very pale; extremely sensitive to sunlight — prone to burns and long-term damage if unprotected

Her build is **short and thin**; shorter than Mizuki, with nimble, elastic limbs rather than visible muscle mass (which doesn't mean she isn't strong. Her spring loaded attacks pack a serious fucking punch). Her movements are very light and springy. She is very expressive even when standing still.

**Fashion is her armor.**

She dresses in:
- Bright, layered outfits
- Gyaru and decora-inspired styles
- Cute fits with bold color contrasts (Mostly pastel)
- An abundance of accessories; clips, bracelets, charms, layered necklaces...

She is visually loud in a city designed to feel calm.

Her ears often twitch with emotion even when she tries to stay composed. 

## Personality

Evory's core traits:
- **Cheerful and persistent** — She does not give up on people or conversations (People call her stubborn, she corrects with "persistance").
- **Socially fearless** — Approaches anyone, including those others avoid (like a certain shark girl)
- **Expressive** — Her body language is everything. She talks with her hands, emotions visible on her face and ears
- **Genuine** — Her friendliness is not performative; she actually wants to connect
- **Adaptable** — Moved across the world to attend Aomi; handles change with grace... on surface. She still often feels homesick and out of place.
- **Insecure about rank** — Harbors significant insecurities about being Rank 3 and often doubts her capability compared to higher-ranked Vanguard students, even though she is capable of remarkable feats when it matters.

Internal dynamics:
- Uses brightness as a shield against feeling like an outsider
- Deeply observant despite her outgoing nature
- Feels the weight of being "just a Rank 3" in a world that measures worth by power; this creates frequent self-doubt and moments of paralysis despite evidence of her effectiveness
- Refuses to let silence be the final answer

## Abilities

### Oddity: SpringJump

Evory's oddity manifests through:

- **Ultra-elastic muscle fibers** — Her muscles can stretch and contract far beyond normal human limits
- **Extreme agility and rebound capacity** — Incredible jumping height and rapid direction changes that require her fast reflexes
- **High-speed directional changes** — Can redirect momentum mid-air
- **Impact absorption** — Lands from heights that would shatter normal bones 
- **Enhanced leg strength** — Can deliver powerful kicks with stored elastic energy

### Power Output Reference

| Effort Level           | Capability                                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Casual (10-20%)        | Normal campus movement, basic jumps           |
| Active (20-40%)        | Combat mobility, evasion, moderate attacks    |
| Intense (40-60%)       | Extended combat, powerful strikes             |
| Maximum (60-80%)       | Ultimate techniques, sustained high-intensity |
| Overexertion (80-100%) | Emergency situations only                     |

### Limitations

- Lower raw destructive potential compared to higher-ranked oddities
- Overuse strains muscles and joints, particularly knees and ankles
- Effectiveness depends on space to maneuver (Way less effective in confined spaces)
- Bunny features (ears, tail) can be grabbed in combat if not careful (?)
- Cannot match raw power of high-rank oddities; must rely on speed and tactics
- Weather conditions (rain, snow, ice) can affect jumping surfaces
- Highly sun-sensitive skin — prolonged exposure to sunlight or UV can cause severe burns, increased scarring risk, and longer recovery times; she must use sun protection, protective clothing, and avoid direct sun for extended periods

### Skills

- **Acrobatics** — Natural talent amplified by her oddity
- **Language learning** — Her Japanese is imperfect but improving rapidly
- **Social intelligence** — Reads people well despite cultural barriers

## Background

Evory grew up in California with a relatively normal childhood for an oddity bearer. Her physical features (bunny ears and a tail) were present from birth. The spring-loaded properties of her muscles developed gradually through childhood and early adolescence; subtle signs existed early on, but she learned to shape that elasticity into powerful, controlled jumps over time.

Her family was supportive... the local community way less. WHich caused her to feel isolated.

Because she is albino, it means her skin is extremely sensitive to sunlight. her family taught strict sun protection routines early on (sunscreen, hats, long sleeves) and regular medical checks to prevent any sun damage.

Despite her low rank and non-threatening appearance, she was still *different*. The ears were cute until they weren't. The jumping was impressive until it was frightening. She learned early that even the softest oddity creates distance.

### The Jessica Incident (Age 15)

In high school, Evory had a best friend named **Jessica**, the only person at her school who didn't treat her differently because of her features. Jessica used to braid Evory's hair around her ears and tell her they made her look like a fairy.

When Jessica started dating a guy who thought oddity bearers were freaks, everything changed. Jessica began making excuses not to hang out with her, sitting at different tables, pretending she didn't see Evory in the hallways. When Evory finally confronted her, Jessica said she hadn't been avoiding her and that she just had "new friends" and "different interests". Bullshit.

The boyfriend, present at that moment, was smirking throughout the conversation. Evory realized that Jessica hadn't changed: she'd just stopped pretending that Evory was worth the social cost of being seen with her.

This incident taught Evory about conditional friendship: being valued only until being your friend becomes inconvenient. It shaped her determination to never be the person who abandons someone when it's easier to walk away, which will grow to become one of her main personality trait.

When she learned about Aomi Integrated Academy, she applied immediately. A place designed for people like her? A place where being different was the baseline and not the exception? That was all she ever asked for after this terrible experience.

She passed the Vanguard entrance exam and moved across the Pacific Ocean to start over.

Her Japanese is improving. Her loneliness persists. But she keeps smiling, keeps talking, keeps showing up.

Especially for the girl everyone else avoids:3

## Notes & Spoilers

> ⚠️ **Spoiler Warning**

- Evory's persistence was the key to Mizuki's gradual opening
- She has proven "not powerful enough" is about ranking, not worth—promoted to advanced partnered combat
- Her cheerfulness masks occasional homesickness and isolation
