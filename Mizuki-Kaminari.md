## Appearance

Mizuki is immediately recognizable, and impossible to ignore. She seems mostly human at first glance, but looking at her for more than 10 seconds reveals the truth of who she is:

- A **shark fin** emerging in her back
- A **dark grey large hammerhead shark tail**, thick, muscular, and covered in rough, abrasive skin, replaces her lower spine (few scars visible on it, more pinkish and softer -> specifically a big one going across the bottom; She never tells where she got that from)
- Her mouth contains visible **rows of sharp, predatory teeth**, even when her expression is neutral. She possesses no normal human teeth

These features contribute a lot to her reputation. Even at rest, she looks dangerous.

**Daily life accommodations:**
- Sleeps on her side or stomach; her fin and tail require specialized sleeping positions (she tried cutting holes in her mattress once, didn't work as planned)
- Sits sideways or on modified furniture with tail cutouts (common in this universe)
- All clothing is modified with tail cutouts and back flaps for her fin

She is **short and thin**, deceptively frail-looking for someone capable of catastrophic output (She still has a very good physical condition from training). Her strength is not obvious in her frame, which only deepens the unease she causes in others. Her movements are efficient, controlled, and almost robotic?

**Physical details:**
- **Hair:** Black, messy, usually loose or simply tied in a ponytail (practical, efficient)
- **Eyes:** Silver, glowing an intense, blinding white when her power is active (she can see just fine through it)
- **Clothing:** Almost exclusively dark tones with:
  - Oversized black hoodies
  - Ripped, baggy black jeans
  - Occasional black dresses or skirts layered with band tees (only for special occasions (that she avoids))
  - All clothing is custom-modified with **tail and fin cutouts**
- **Footwear:** One pair only; **heavy-duty black combat boots**, reinforced with steel plating in select areas
  - She loves them - gift from her parents
  - Refuses replacements

She never smiles much not because she is cruel or joyless, but because her face was never taught how to look non-threatening. When she is silent, people assume hostility. When she speaks bluntly, they assume aggression.

## Personality

### Mizuki's core traits:

- **Stoic and controlled** — Years of managing her overwhelming power have made restraint her default behavior

- **Blunt** — She does not soften words; this is often mistaken for hostility. she's not mean, she just keeps people at arm's length

- **Isolated by circumstance** — She has learned that closeness is dangerous, both for herself and the ones around her

- **Deeply lonely** — Beneath the walls, she craves connection pretty badly but fears the variables it introduces

- **Protective** - When she does allow someone close, she will destroy anything that threatens them, no matter the consequences

Internal conflicts:

- Wants connection but fears the consequences of letting someone in

- Resents being seen as a monster but understands why people see her that way (sorta, explained below)

- Struggles with the gap between who she is and how she is perceived

## Abilities

### Oddity: Lightning Generation and Manipulation

Mizuki's oddity manifests as overwhelming electrical capability:

- **Constant internal electrical generation** — Her body produces electricity continuously, she needs to discharge it at least once a day (not a real issue with her training)
- **Environmental absorption and amplification** — She can draw power from *ALL* electrical sources around her (within a 20m radius)
- **Lightning arcs and controlled discharges** — Precision strikes or wide-area devastation
- **EMP-like bursts** — Can disrupt electronics in her vicinity (depending on output, could turn a whole city dark)

Her eyes glow a blinding white when she channels power, and the air around her subtly shifts: static pressure, ionization, the sense that something enormous is barely contained like a storm cloud about to explode.

| 80-100%    | Theoretical maximum, never tested (could potentially cause irreversible damage to herself) |

### Limitations

- The greater the output, the greater the physical and psychological toll (Nerve damage, headaches, breathing difficulties, intense sweating...)
- Extended use causes dissociation and strain on neural structures
- She must constantly regulate her internal charge to avoid passive damage to surroundings
- High power usage causes eye glow to become blinding white
- Post-high-output recovery involves extreme fatigue, headaches, and emotional instability (Like she has her periods lmaoo)
- Cannot fully control power while sleeping (risk of accidental discharge during nightmares)

### Skills

- **Combat proficiency** — Trained through the Vanguard Program (Entered Aomi at 15 when entering highschool, followed a special program)
- **Environmental awareness** — Hyper-aware of electrical fields and conductivity
- **Swimming** — Finds solace in the ocean; an excellent swimmer thanks to her her shark-like features

## Preferences

Things Mizuki enjoys:
- **Old music** — Things her parents used to play before everything turned dark
- **Rain** — Because it makes the world quieter and dims her powers
- **Her boots** — The only thing she owns that she actually cherishes
- **The ocean** — Because it doesn't stare, calculate, or decide she's too dangerous to approach

## Background

Mizuki's oddity manifested early, too early. She was born with her shark features and started generating electricity at **age 4**. She is one of the earliest confirmed cases of oddity bearers. She grew up in **Sapporo**, a cold town on the Hokkaido island (to which it's the capital) where snow is common and mountains rise all around. She lived in the rural suburbs, peaceful and quiet. The exact circumstances of how she manifested are fairly obscure because she's so discreet. But the result was unmistakable: a child who could level buildings before she understood what electricity even was.

She was identified and placed at Aomi Integrated Academy as soon as she was old enough to join the highschool. Her admission was not an application, it was a **direct recommendation**, the polite term for individuals too dangerous to refuse and too valuable to ignore.

At Aomi, she has spent years learning control, not power. The difference between what she *can* do and what she actually *allows* herself to do is gigantic.

### The Ayumi Incident (Age 14)

At **age 14**, during her preliminary monitoring program for AIA, Mizuki "befriended" **Ayumi** (a non-oddity bearer who worked in the program: handling daily logistics like meals, laundry). Ayumi was the first person who wasn't afraid of Mizuki. She was curious, asked questions about what it felt like to have shark features ("Is it hard to sleep?", "How do you manage to sleep?", "Do you ever get tired of it?", "Ever bit your tongue by accident?"), whether Mizuki could sense things through electromagnetic fields like a shark can, whether the electricity hurt, how she got the scars on her tail. The girl even used to sneak extra desserts and snacks for Mizuki in her bedroom, saying she was too skinny for her own good. Mizuki basically saw her as a big sister.

One night, Mizuki (who didn't have full control over her oddity yet due to lack of training) had a severe enough nightmare to lose control in her sleep. When she woke up, the walls were scorched and the electronics in her and other adjacent rooms were completely fried. Ayumi had heard Mizuki calling out and came to check on her—witnessing the aftermath of what her power could do when uncontrolled. The room still smoking and the air was thick with ozone.

Ayumi was never physically hurt. But she saw what Mizuki was capable of without restraint. She requested a transfer and was gone within a week. She never spoke to Mizuki again.

After that, Mizuki who was already lonely enough decided that isolation was easier. Safer. Less complicated. The incident taught her that closeness is dangerous, not through intentional harm, but through the simple reality that accidents happen, and being near her carries risk.

She has no close friends. Not by choice, but by gravity. People orbit her warily. The few who approached too quickly learned that Mizuki's presence is not comfortable.

The ocean is her sanctuary. Salt water does not stare. It does not flinch. It helps regulate her electrical charge, dissipating the constant buildup that her oddity generates.

## Notes & Spoilers

> ⚠️ **Spoiler Warning**

- Mizuki's relationship with Ellie will develop through persistence and crisis
- Long-term neurological effects of her oddity are unknown (TBD idfk what im doing with that yet, might explore or might just leave it as a minor part of the story)
