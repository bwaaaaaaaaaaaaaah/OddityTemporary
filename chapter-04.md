# Chapter 4 ,  The Beach

The weekend arrived like a gift Ellie hadn't known she needed.

No training. No lectures on the cost of power or the mechanics of oddity manifestation. No tactical scenarios where she launched herself between platforms while Takeshi Honda watched with that unreadable expression, cataloging every imperfection in her form.

Just two days of nothing.

Hana had suggested they explore the city together, "You've been here almost two weeks and you've barely left campus. That's tragic, Ellie. Genuinely tragic.", and Ellie had agreed with the kind of enthusiasm that came from being exhausted and desperate for distraction.

The plan was simple: walk through the Commercial District, find somewhere good to eat, maybe visit one of the seaside cafés Hana had mentioned. Normal activities. The kind of thing normal students did on normal weekends.

But as they walked along the tree-lined pathway that connected campus to the wider city, Ellie's thoughts kept drifting somewhere else.

Three days had passed since the training session. Three days since she'd watched Mizuki reshape the Training Complex with lightning, then sit alone in the Medical Wing while someone measured what it cost her. Three days since that brief exchange in the corridor, *most people stay away after they see what I can do*, and the look in Mizuki's silver eyes that had been something other than dismissal.

She hadn't seen Mizuki since.

Not in the cafeteria. Not in the hallways. Not anywhere on campus where their paths might reasonably cross.

It was as if the demonstration had pushed her even further into isolation. As if showing the full extent of her power had reminded her, or reminded everyone else, exactly why that bubble of space followed her everywhere.

Ellie's ears flattened slightly, an involuntary tell she still hadn't learned to control.

"You're doing it again." Hana said.

"Doing what?"

"Drifting. You've been half-present all morning." Hana's purple hair caught the afternoon sunlight as she glanced sideways at Ellie. "Let me guess, you're still thinking about Kaminari."

It wasn't really a question.

"I haven't seen her," Ellie admitted. "Since the training thing. I thought maybe she'd be in the cafeteria, or I'd run into her on campus, but..."

"She does that sometimes." Hana's voice was careful, the tone of someone sharing information they weren't entirely sure they should share. "After big demonstrations or intense training sessions. She disappears for a few days. No one knows where she goes."

"No one?"

"I mean, people have theories. Some say she has a secret training location. Others think she leaves the city entirely, goes somewhere with less... people." Hana shrugged. "Honestly, most people don't think about it too hard. When someone that powerful wants to disappear, you don't go looking for them."

Ellie processed this. The idea of Mizuki needing to disappear, needing space away from everyone, away from even the Academy that was supposedly designed to understand people like her, felt significant. And sad. And achingly familiar in a way she didn't want to examine too closely.

"What about you?" Ellie asked. "Don't you ever wonder where she goes?"

Hana was quiet for a moment. When she spoke, her voice was softer. "Honestly? I try not to think about it. Kaminari is... she's in a different category. Different world, almost. The rest of us worry about passing exams and making friends and figuring out how to control our oddities. She's already past all that. She's dealing with something the rest of us can't even imagine."

"That doesn't mean she should have to deal with it alone."

Hana stopped walking. She turned to face Ellie with an expression that was equal parts exasperation and something else, something that might have been concern.

"Ellie. I like you. You're friendly and determined and you make the cafeteria more interesting. But you need to understand something about Mizuki Kaminari." She paused, choosing her words. "She's not a project. She's not a puzzle you can solve by being persistent enough. She's a Rank 9 oddity bearer with a manifestation that could level a building, and she's spent years learning to exist in a world that's afraid of her. That's not something you fix with cheerfulness."

"I know that."

"Do you? Because it feels like you're treating her like someone who just needs a friend, and maybe that's true, but maybe it's also more complicated than that. Maybe the isolation isn't just something that happened to her, maybe it's something she chose, because the alternative was worse."

Ellie's hands clenched at her sides. The words stung because there was truth in them, even if the truth wasn't the whole story.

"I'm not trying to fix her," she said quietly. "I'm just trying to see her. Actually see her. Everyone else looks at her and sees the power, or the danger, or the isolation. I want to see the person underneath all that."

Hana studied her for a long moment. Something shifted in her expression, the exasperation fading into something more like respect.

"You're stubborn," she said finally.

"I've been told."

"It's not always a compliment."

"I know that too."

Hana sighed, but there was a smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. "Okay. Well. If you're determined to care about someone who probably doesn't want you to, I'm not going to stop you. Just... be careful. For your sake and hers."

Ellie nodded, even as her mind was already somewhere else.

*Where does she go when she disappears?*

---

The Commercial District was everything the campus wasn't: vibrant, crowded, overwhelming in the best possible way.

Small shops lined narrow streets, their facades decorated with neon signs and hanging plants and the peculiar charm of businesses that had been family-owned for generations. Food stalls offered things Ellie couldn't identify but wanted to try. Music spilled from open doorways. Students from the Academy mixed with Aomi's general population, and for a few hours, the distinction between oddity bearer and ordinary citizen seemed to blur.

Hana guided her through the maze of streets with the confidence of someone who had spent months learning the layout. They stopped at a bakery that made pastries shaped like animals. They browsed a clothing store where everything was customized for oddity accommodations, Ellie found a dress with built-in tail openings that would have saved her hours of sewing back in California. They ate lunch at a ramen shop so small that the counter doubled as the entire seating area, and the chef watched them eat with the particular pride of someone who knew their food was excellent.

It was good. All of it was good.

But as the afternoon stretched toward evening, Ellie found herself growing restless.

The restlessness was familiar. It was the same feeling she got when she'd been social for too long, not exhaustion, exactly, but a kind of saturation. She loved people. She genuinely did. But sometimes she needed space. Sometimes she needed to move, to explore, to find something that was hers alone.

"You're drifting again," Hana observed, catching her gaze wandering toward the coastline visible between buildings.

"Sorry. I think I need to walk for a bit. Clear my head."

Hana's expression shifted to something knowing. "Uh-huh. And this walk wouldn't happen to take you somewhere specific?"

"I don't know where I'm going." It was the truth. Mostly.

"Sure." Hana's tone was skeptical but not unkind. "Well, I need to get back to campus anyway, I have a study session with the sonic control group at five. But if you want to explore, the Waterfront District is nice. Especially the parts east of the main promenades. Quieter. Good for... walking."

The way she said it made Ellie's ears twitch.

"Hana?"

"Hmm?"

"You know something, don't you."

Hana's smile was cryptic. "I know lots of things. Some of them I'm choosing not to say because you need to find them out yourself." She reached out and squeezed Ellie's shoulder briefly. "Good luck, bunny girl. Don't do anything I wouldn't do."

And then she was gone, disappearing into the crowd with a wave.

Ellie stood in the middle of the Commercial District for a moment, processing the exchange. Hana had been trying to tell her something without telling her directly. The Waterfront District. East of the main promenades. Quieter.

*Where someone might go to disappear.*

She started walking.

---

The path east from the main promenades grew narrower as Ellie followed it.

The soft bioluminescent lighting that marked most of Aomi's walkways faded here, replaced by natural vegetation, salt-resistant grasses, low shrubs, the occasional twisted tree shaped by coastal winds. The sounds of the city receded, replaced by something older: waves, wind, the cry of seabirds overhead.

Ellie's ears tracked every sound as she walked, her body instinctively cataloging potential threats even as her mind focused on something else entirely.

She didn't know if Mizuki was here. She didn't even know if this was where she went when she disappeared. But something in Hana's cryptic guidance had felt significant, and Ellie had learned to trust her instincts.

The path curved around a natural outcropping of rock, and suddenly the city was gone.

In its place: the beach.

Not a manufactured recreation area with designated swimming zones and safety barriers. This was raw coastline, coarse sand mixed with stones and shells, large rocks at the waterline creating tide pools, the Pacific stretching endlessly toward a horizon that caught the late afternoon light in shades of gold and pink and amber.

It was beautiful in a way that felt almost accidental, like nature had carved this space and then forgotten to tell anyone it existed.

And there, floating in the shallows maybe thirty meters from shore, was Mizuki Kaminari.

Ellie froze.

She could only see the silhouette at first, a dark shape against the golden water, barely moving. But as her eyes adjusted, the details emerged: black hair spreading across the surface like an oil slick, the distinctive dorsal fin breaking the waterline, the stillness of someone who had stopped fighting the current and simply let it carry them.

She was floating on her back. Eyes closed. Face turned toward the sky.

For a long moment, Ellie just watched.

There was something in Mizuki's posture that she'd never seen before, not in the cafeteria, not in class, not even in the Medical Wing after the training demonstration. The constant tension that seemed to define her existence had loosened. Her shoulders were down. Her hands floated at her sides, fingers occasionally brushing the water in lazy movements. Her expression was... peaceful.

Or as close to peaceful as someone like Mizuki could get.

*This is her sanctuary,* Ellie realized. *This is where she comes to be alone.*

The thought was accompanied by a sharp pang of guilt. She shouldn't be here. Mizuki had clearly chosen this place precisely because no one knew about it, or at least, no one came here. It was her space. Her refuge from the constant pressure of being visible, being feared, being watched.

And Ellie was intruding.

She should leave. She should turn around, walk back to the main promenades, and pretend she'd never found this place.

But her feet wouldn't move.

She stood on the edge of the beach, bunny ears pressed flat against her skull with indecision, watching the girl who scared everyone float peacefully in the cold Pacific water.

*What do I do?*

The question hung in her mind, unanswered.

And then Mizuki's eyes opened.

Silver caught gold as the fading sunlight reflected off the water. Even from thirty meters away, Ellie could see the exact moment recognition registered, the slight tensing of shoulders, the way Mizuki's feet found the bottom as she shifted from floating to standing in the chest-deep water.

They stared at each other across the distance.

Ellie's heart was hammering so loud she was sure Mizuki could hear it. Her fight-or-flight instincts were screaming contradictory instructions. Every social calculation she knew was failing, because there was no protocol for this. No guideline for what you did when you accidentally stumbled upon someone's private sanctuary and got caught.

Mizuki didn't move. Didn't speak. Just stood in the water, watching.

Waiting.

*She's giving me a choice,* Ellie realized. *Stay or leave. Intrude or retreat.*

And she understood, with a clarity that felt almost painful, that this moment would define something. If she left now, Mizuki would have her answer. The persistent bunny girl was just like everyone else, willing to push but not willing to really enter her space. Another person who approached out of curiosity or pity and then retreated when things got too real.

But if she stayed...

Ellie took a breath.

She walked onto the beach.

---

The sand crunched under her shoes as she approached the waterline, not too fast, not too aggressive. Just steady. Present.

Mizuki watched her come with that unreadable expression, silver eyes tracking every movement. The water lapped at her chest, her fin barely visible above the surface, her tail presumably trailing behind her in the deeper water.

Ellie stopped at the edge of the waves, close enough that they occasionally washed over her feet, soaking through her canvas shoes. She didn't care. Getting her feet wet wasn't even in the top ten concerns right now.

The silence stretched between them.

*Say something,* Ellie's brain commanded. *Say something before this gets weird. Something friendly. Something normal. Something that makes this feel like a casual encounter instead of whatever this actually is.*

But nothing felt right. Every prepared line, *oh, I didn't know you came here*; *what a coincidence running into you*; *nice weather, isn't it*, rang hollow. They were lies, or at least evasions. And somehow, in this moment, Ellie couldn't bring herself to offer Mizuki anything other than truth.

"I was looking for you."

The words came out before she could stop them.

Mizuki's expression didn't change, but something flickered in her eyes. Not quite surprise. More like confirmation of something she'd already suspected.

"Why?"

The question was flat. Direct. Classic Mizuki.

Ellie considered her answer. The easy response would be something about concern, *I was worried about you after the training session*; *I noticed you disappeared and wanted to check on you*. Those were true, as far as they went. But they also felt incomplete.

"Because you've been gone," she said finally. "Three days. And I realized I don't know anything about you except what I've observed. I don't know where you go when you're not on campus. I don't know what you like or what you think about or what makes you feel something other than... controlled. I know you have walls. I know everyone stays away. But I don't know why that bothers me so much when I barely know you at all."

The words tumbled out in a rush, carried by momentum she couldn't have stopped even if she'd wanted to. It was honest. Maybe too honest. The kind of raw admission that usually made people uncomfortable.

Mizuki stared at her.

The silence that followed was longer this time, long enough that Ellie's anxiety started to spike, her ears twitching with nervous energy. She'd pushed too far. Said too much. This was the moment where Mizuki told her to leave and never come back, and the fragile something they'd been building collapsed into nothing.

But Mizuki didn't tell her to leave.

Instead, she moved.

She walked through the water toward shore, her movements slow and deliberate, the way someone moved when they weren't sure if they were approaching or retreating. Water streamed from her body as the depth decreased, revealing the full extent of her form, the modified black swimsuit that accommodated her fin and tail, the shark-like skin that covered parts of her torso, the predatory grace that made her simultaneously beautiful and terrifying.

She stopped at the water's edge, close enough that Ellie could see the droplets catching light on her face.

"You're strange."

It was the same thing she'd said in the Medical Wing corridor. But the tone was different now. Less accusation, more... observation.

"So I've been told." Ellie managed a small smile. "Multiple times. By multiple people. It's becoming a theme."

"You know what I can do." Mizuki's voice was quieter now, rougher. "You saw it. The training floor. The lightning. The, " She stopped, as if the words were difficult. "Everyone who sees that stays away. Every time. That's how it works."

"I know."

"But you came looking for me."

"I know."

Mizuki's eyes searched her face, looking for something. Ellie didn't know what, maybe deception, maybe fear hidden behind friendliness, maybe the tell that would reveal this was all some kind of act.

Whatever she was looking for, she apparently didn't find it.

"Why?" The question was softer this time. Less demand, more genuine bewilderment.

Ellie considered the question. Really considered it, instead of defaulting to the cheerful optimism that usually served as her first response.

"I grew up feeling like I didn't fit anywhere," she said slowly. "My oddity manifested when I was nine. One morning I woke up with ears and a tail, and suddenly I was the weird bunny girl. People didn't hate me. They just... kept distance. Like there was this invisible line around me that everyone could see except me."

She paused, gathering her thoughts.

"I came to Aomi because I thought it would be different here. A place for people like me. But the first night, I saw you in the cafeteria, and everyone was doing the same thing. Keeping distance. Treating you like you were radioactive or fragile or something to be avoided. And I thought, " Her voice cracked slightly. "I thought that wasn't fair. That even here, in a place designed to accept people who are different, there was still someone sitting alone. Someone everyone had decided was too much to approach."

Mizuki was very still. Her silver eyes hadn't left Ellie's face.

"I don't know why that bothers me so much," Ellie admitted. "Maybe it's because I see something in you that reminds me of how I felt before I learned to hide it. Maybe it's because you're interesting and I want to understand you. Maybe I'm just stubborn and bad at accepting when people don't want to be approached." She took a breath. "But whatever the reason, I keep finding myself thinking about you. Wondering where you go. Worrying when you disappear."

The confession hung in the air between them, raw and unguarded.

Mizuki's expression had shifted during Ellie's speech. The neutral mask had cracked slightly, revealing something underneath, something vulnerable and uncertain and achingly human beneath all the power and the isolation.

"That's a dangerous way to feel about someone like me."

The words were quiet. Almost gentle.

"I know," Ellie said. "But I don't think I can stop."

---

Silence settled over the beach.

Not the tense silence of conflict or the awkward silence of failed conversation. Something different. Something that felt like the space between words where meaning lived.

Mizuki stood at the water's edge, the waves lapping at her feet, her expression unreadable but somehow less closed than before. Ellie stood a few feet away, her shoes thoroughly soaked, her heart beating a rhythm that felt too loud for the quiet surroundings.

When Mizuki moved, it was almost imperceptible. A slight shift of weight. A loosening of her shoulders. The beginning of something that might, in someone else, have been an invitation.

She turned and walked back into the water.

Not far, just to where the waves reached her waist. Then she stopped and looked back over her shoulder at Ellie.

"You can stay," she said. "If you want. But I'm not getting out of the water."

Ellie blinked. "Okay?"

"I come here to regulate." Mizuki's voice was matter-of-fact, the tone of someone explaining something she'd never had to explain before. "My oddity generates electricity constantly. Salt water helps dissipate it. Makes the charge... easier to manage. If I don't spend time in the ocean regularly, the buildup becomes uncomfortable."

It was information. Real information, offered without prompting or pressure. The first time Mizuki had volunteered anything about herself beyond flat rejections.

Ellie filed it away carefully, *salt water dissipates electrical charge; that's why she comes here*, and kicked off her ruined shoes.

"What are you doing?"

"Coming in." Ellie rolled up her pants, already accepting they were going to get soaked regardless. "You said I could stay. Seems rude to stay on the beach while you're in the water."

Mizuki's expression flickered with something that might have been surprise. Or alarm. It was hard to tell with her.

"The water is cold."

"I'm from California. I've been in cold water before."

"The current can be strong."

"I'm a good swimmer."

"You're..." Mizuki trailed off, as if she'd run out of objections. Her tail twitched slightly, that same barely-perceptible movement Ellie had noticed in the cafeteria.

*A tell,* Ellie thought. *She's uncertain.*

She waded into the water before Mizuki could find another reason to object.

The cold hit her immediately, sharper than she'd expected, enough to make her gasp. But it was manageable. Bracing, even. She pushed through the shallows until she was deep enough that the waves reached her waist, then stopped a comfortable distance from Mizuki.

Close enough to talk. Far enough to respect boundaries.

"See?" She grinned, fighting to keep her teeth from chattering. "Not so bad."

Mizuki stared at her like she was witnessing something impossible.

"You're shivering."

"Only a little."

"Your lips are turning blue."

"That's a mild exaggeration."

"It's not." But there was something in Mizuki's voice that sounded almost like... amusement? A distant cousin of it, at least. The ghost of an emotion she'd forgotten how to express.

Ellie's heart did something complicated in her chest.

"The cold is refreshing," she insisted. "Invigorating. Builds character."

"You'll get hypothermia."

"Worth it."

Mizuki's silver eyes searched her face again, looking for the thing she kept looking for, the evidence that this was an act, a performance, a deception waiting to be revealed.

Whatever she found instead made something shift in her expression.

"You really don't care that you're miserable right now."

"I'm not miserable." Ellie's smile was genuine despite the cold seeping into her bones. "I'm exactly where I want to be."

The words landed in the space between them.

Mizuki looked away. Toward the horizon, where the sun was beginning its descent toward the water. Her profile was sharp against the golden light, predatory and beautiful and so achingly lonely that Ellie felt her chest tighten.

"I don't understand you," Mizuki said quietly. "I don't understand why you keep doing this. Everyone else sees what I am and they make rational calculations about risk and reward. They decide the danger outweighs the benefit and they stay away. It's logical. It's sensible. It's what I would do in their position."

She paused.

"But you don't do any of that. You just... show up. Again and again. Like the power and the isolation and the teeth don't matter. Like I'm just... someone worth knowing."

"You are."

"You don't know that." Mizuki's voice cracked slightly. "You don't know anything about me."

"Then tell me something."

The challenge was gentle, but it was still a challenge. An invitation wrapped in a dare.

Mizuki was quiet for a long moment. The waves moved around them, cold and constant, and the sun continued its slow descent.

When she spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper.

"I don't remember the last time someone asked."

Ellie waited. Didn't push. Didn't fill the silence with noise. Just stood in the cold water, ears forward, listening.

"I like the ocean," Mizuki said finally. "Not because of the electrical regulation, though that matters. I like it because the water doesn't stare. It doesn't calculate. It doesn't decide I'm too dangerous to approach. It just... is. And when I'm floating in it, I can pretend for a few hours that I'm just a girl. Not a rank. Not a variable. Not something people are afraid of."

Her voice was rough, scraped raw by an honesty she clearly wasn't used to offering.

"I like music. Old stuff, things my parents used to play before everything happened. I like rain because it makes the world quieter. I like the feeling of my boots because they're the only thing I own that I actually chose instead of having modified for my body."

She turned to look at Ellie, and her silver eyes were bright with something that might have been tears or might have been the fading light.

"And I don't know how to do this," she admitted. "Talk to someone. Let someone in. The last time I tried, I was fourteen, and it ended badly, and I decided afterward that it was easier to be alone. Safer. Less complicated."

"What happened?"

The question slipped out before Ellie could stop it.

Mizuki flinched, a small movement, barely visible. "I hurt someone. Not on purpose. Not even with my power. Just... being close to me was enough. The pressure of it. The weight of who I am. They couldn't handle it, and I couldn't change enough to make it work, and in the end it was my fault for thinking it could be different."

The confession hung in the cold air between them.

Ellie wanted to reach out. Wanted to close the distance between them and do something, touch her shoulder, take her hand, offer some physical comfort that would translate the feelings she couldn't put into words.

But she didn't. Because she understood, instinctively, that Mizuki wasn't ready for that. That this moment, standing in cold water, sharing fragments of truth, being present without demanding more, was already more than she'd allowed herself in years.

"I'm not going anywhere," Ellie said softly. "I know you don't believe that yet. I know you're waiting for me to realize you're too much and back away like everyone else. But I'm not going anywhere."

Mizuki's tail moved in the water, a slow, uncertain swish.

"You can't promise that."

"No," Ellie agreed. "I can't promise I won't get hurt, or that this will be easy, or that we'll both come out of this fine. But I can promise that I'm here right now. That I'm choosing to be here. That I'm not going to run just because you have teeth and lightning and a really intimidating tail."

The barest hint of a smile touched Mizuki's lips. Gone almost before it existed.

But Ellie saw it.

*She smiled. Just for a second. But she smiled.*

"You're strange," Mizuki said again. But this time it sounded less like an accusation and more like something else. Something almost warm.

"So are you." Ellie grinned despite the cold that was definitely seeping into her bones now. "Guess that makes two of us."

---

They stayed in the water until the sun was nearly gone.

Ellie's lips were definitely blue by the end, she'd caught her reflection in the surface and couldn't deny it anymore, and her hands had gone numb somewhere around the forty-minute mark. But she didn't leave. Didn't even suggest leaving.

Neither did Mizuki.

They didn't talk constantly. Long stretches of silence passed between them, filled only by the sound of waves and the distant cry of seabirds returning to shore. But the silence was comfortable. Shared. The kind of quiet that felt like presence rather than absence.

When they did talk, it was small things.

Ellie described California, the beaches that were warmer than this one, the way the light was different there, the feeling of leaving everything familiar to come to a place where she knew no one.

Mizuki mentioned, in fragments, that she'd grown up in Sapporo. That she'd manifested at four years old, earlier than almost anyone. That she remembered the exact moment when she'd realized the electricity inside her wasn't going away.

Neither of them mentioned the training demonstration, or the Medical Wing, or the way everyone on campus treated Mizuki like a live wire. Those subjects felt too heavy for this moment. Too much weight for a connection that was still so new.

Instead, they talked around those things. Built the foundation without trying to construct the entire building.

When the light finally faded to the point where even Ellie's stubbornness couldn't justify staying any longer, Mizuki was the one who spoke first.

"You should go back."

"Probably." Ellie's teeth were chattering audibly now. "Before I actually get hypothermia and have to explain to Dr. Chen why I was swimming fully clothed."

Mizuki's expression flickered with that ghost of amusement again. "That would be difficult to explain."

"Extremely." Ellie started wading toward shore, her legs stiff from the cold. "But worth it."

She'd almost reached the beach when Mizuki's voice stopped her.

"Wood."

Ellie turned, waist-deep in the fading light.

Mizuki was still standing in the water, silhouetted against the darkening sky. Her expression was harder to read in the low light, but her voice carried clearly across the distance.

"Why do you keep trying?"

It was the question she'd been circling all afternoon. The question at the core of everything.

Ellie thought about it. Really thought, instead of reaching for the easy answer or the comfortable deflection.

"Because I think you're worth knowing," she said finally. "Not because of your power or despite it. Just... you. The person who likes old music and rain and boots she chose for herself. The person who comes to the ocean to feel normal for a few hours. That person seems worth knowing. And I want to be the one who gets to know her."

Mizuki was silent.

The waves lapped at the shore. The last light faded from the sky.

And then, so quietly that Ellie almost missed it:

"Come back tomorrow. Same time. If you want."

Ellie's heart soared.

"I'll be here."

---

The walk back to campus felt different than the walk out.

Ellie's clothes were soaked, her shoes were ruined, and she was shivering badly enough that a passing student asked if she needed help. But she was smiling. She couldn't stop smiling.

Something had shifted.

Not dramatically, not the kind of shift that happened in stories where one conversation changed everything. This was smaller than that. More fragile. More real.

Mizuki had let her in. Just a crack. Just enough to see past the walls to the person behind them. And she'd asked Ellie to come back.

*Come back tomorrow. Same time. If you want.*

Want. As if there was any question.

Ellie practically bounced through the campus gates, her oddity making her steps lighter than gravity should allow. She was cold and wet and probably going to catch a cold, and she didn't care about any of it.

Tomorrow, she would go back to the beach.

Tomorrow, she would sit in cold water and let silence be comfortable.

Tomorrow, she would learn something else about Mizuki Kaminari.

And maybe, eventually, the girl who was terrified of letting anyone close would realize that Ellie wasn't going anywhere.

---

That night, lying in her dorm room with the plush bunny tucked under her arm and a heating pad pressed against her still-cold feet, Ellie stared at the ceiling and replayed every moment of the afternoon.

Mizuki floating in the water. The surprise in her eyes when she saw Ellie on the beach. The way her voice had softened as she talked about music and rain and the ocean that didn't stare.

*I don't remember the last time someone asked.*

The words echoed in Ellie's mind, achingly sad.

She thought about Hana's warning, *she's not a project*, and knew that her friend had been partially right. Mizuki wasn't something to be fixed or saved. She was a complete person who had made choices about how to exist in a world that was afraid of her, and those choices deserved respect.

But she was also lonely.

Ellie had seen it in the way she talked about the ocean, *it doesn't stare, it doesn't calculate*. She'd heard it in the confession about the friend she'd hurt at fourteen, the decision that isolation was safer than trying again.

Mizuki had chosen to be alone because she believed she was too dangerous to be close to.

And maybe she was right. Maybe getting close to someone with Rank 9 power meant accepting risks that most people couldn't calculate. Maybe the logical, sensible thing to do was exactly what everyone else did, keep distance, maintain the bubble, treat her as a variable rather than a person.

But Ellie had never been particularly logical about the things that mattered.

She closed her eyes and remembered the almost-smile that had crossed Mizuki's face in the water. That tiny flicker of warmth that had appeared and vanished so quickly it might have been imagined.

*She smiled,* Ellie thought. *She smiled, and she asked me to come back.*

That was enough. For now, that was enough.

Sleep came easier than expected, and in her dreams, the ocean was cold and peaceful, and somewhere beneath the waves, something powerful was learning to trust.
